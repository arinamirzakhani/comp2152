# Defining Variables
# Define an array variable with the elements 1, 4, 7, 9
array = [1, 4, 7, 9]

# Order of Operations
# Fully-Bracketed Version of e = a - b ** c // d + a % c
# Variables definition
a = 1
b = 2
c = 3
d = 4

# Fully-Bracketed Version
e = ((a - ((b ** c) // d)) + (a % c))

# ormatting
# Create a variable called "temperature" with the value 32.6
temperature = 32.6
# Print the formatted string
print("The temperature today is: {:.3f} degrees Celsius".format(temperature))

# Common Functions
# Ask the user to input their age
userAge = int(input("Enter your age: "))
# Add 22 to the user input
userAge += 22
# Print the resulting statement
print(f"Now showing the shop items filtered by age: {userAge}")
